  <h2>Smart Cities Mission Overview</h2>
  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.2qfHfDqVfx9YQTimbpMRyAHaFj?w=800&h=600&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Smart Cities Logo" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:auto;">
  <p>The Smart Cities Mission is an initiative by the Government of India aimed at promoting cities that provide core infrastructure, a clean and sustainable environment, and a decent quality of life to their citizens through the application of smart solutions. Launched on June 25, 2015, the mission's objective is to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life by enabling local area development and harnessing technology.</p>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure adequate water and electricity supply.</li>
    <li>Provide efficient urban mobility and public transport.</li>
    <li>Offer affordable housing, especially for the poor.</li>
    <li>Implement robust IT connectivity and digitalization.</li>
    <li>Enhance good governance, especially e-Governance and citizen participation.</li>
    <li>Promote sustainable environment and safety of citizens.</li>
    <li>Develop health and education infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ôªÔ∏è Biochemical Processes & Composting</h2>
  <img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/biochemicalprocess-161216140712/95/biochemical-processpptx-123-12-638.jpg?cb=1481897313" alt="Composting" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:auto;">
  <p>Biochemical processes are essential for managing organic waste in urban areas. These processes involve the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms, leading to the production of compost, which can be used as a soil conditioner.</p>

  <h3>Key Methods:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Composting:</strong> Aerobic decomposition of organic waste, resulting in nutrient-rich compost.</li>
    <li><strong>Vermicomposting:</strong> Use of earthworms to convert organic waste into high-quality compost.</li>
    <li><strong>Anaerobic Digestion:</strong> Breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas and digestate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These methods not only reduce the volume of waste but also minimize greenhouse gas emissions and produce valuable by-products.</p>

  <h2>‚ö° Energy Recovery from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)</h2>
  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.7pDcZd7w4QrJt32JX1a6FQHaFG?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Energy Recovery" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:auto;">
  <p>Energy recovery from MSW involves converting non-recyclable waste materials into usable forms of energy, such as electricity, heat, or fuel.</p>

  <h3>Technologies:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incineration:</strong> Combustion of waste to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Gasification:</strong> Conversion of organic materials into syngas through high-temperature processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Pyrolysis:</strong> Thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These technologies help in reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and decrease the volume of waste sent to landfills.</p>

  <h2>üöß Current Issues in Solid Waste Management</h2>
  <p>Despite advancements, several challenges persist in the effective management of solid waste:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Segregation:</strong> Mixing of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste complicates processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Inadequate Infrastructure:</strong> Insufficient facilities for collection, transportation, and processing of waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Limited understanding among citizens about waste segregation and disposal practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Policy Implementation:</strong> Gaps in enforcing regulations and monitoring waste management practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Addressing these issues requires a collaborative approach involving government bodies, private sectors, and the community.</p>
